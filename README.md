# Markov Sentence Bot
Discord bot that generates sentences by Markov chain

## Require
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

```py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py```

- [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)

```pip install markovify```

- [janome](https://github.com/mocobeta/janome)

```pip install janome```

## Commands
```/markov [@user] Optional:[Number of acquisitions]```

ex.

```/markov @markov @chain 100```

In this example, a single sentence is generated based on the messages from markov and chain in the last 100 messages.

### [@user] : mention someone

Mentioning more than one person is possible. Mentioning multiple people generates a single sentence from their sentences.
 
### [Number of acquisitions] : Enter any integer. (Can be omitted).

Specify the number of messages in the past for the target text channel. The model is generated by extracting the target user's messages from the total number of messages. If no messages are entered, all messages will be selected.
